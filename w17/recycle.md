# How to write a solution that would work best for recycle challenge
- I done the code on accident before wrinting md file but how I done it was, I would make them all checkmarks and do something similar to the dish_washer checkmark. By adding them into FP.js and would make a function and if and else statement for each checkmark. That being if the user unchecks whichever item they don't recycle. JS would then add a 4 to that recycle points. Else the recycle points will stay at 0. Which now I think if it should have been other way around but I forgot it was subtracking instead of adding.
